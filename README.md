## Introduction to SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that enable developers to write more maintainable, understandable, and flexible code. These principles form the foundation of good object-oriented design and are critical in creating scalable software systems.

- **S**: **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** - A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. It ensures that a class has only one job or responsibility.

- **O**: **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** - Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. It promotes building systems that are easily extendable without altering existing code.

- **L**: **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. It ensures that a derived class can be used in place of a base class.

- **I**: **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** - No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. It promotes creating small, specific interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones.

- **D**: **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces). This principle reduces the coupling between software modules.

### Use Cases of Low-Level Design Patterns

Low-level design patterns are instrumental in solving recurring problems in software design. These patterns provide a template or blueprint for structuring code in a way that is both efficient and maintainable. They are particularly useful in:

- **Code Reusability**: Patterns like Singleton and Factory promote code reuse by standardizing object creation and management.
- **Flexibility and Extensibility**: Patterns such as Strategy and Decorator allow the system to adapt to new requirements with minimal changes.
- **Decoupling**: Patterns like Observer and Adapter reduce the dependencies between different parts of a system, making it more modular and easier to maintain.
- **Testability**: By following patterns, code becomes more modular, making it easier to write unit tests and achieve better test coverage.

## Famous Design Patterns

### 1. Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is commonly used in scenarios where a single resource, such as a database connection or a configuration file, needs to be shared across the system.

### 2. Factory Pattern

The Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It is widely used in cases where the exact type of the object might not be known until runtime.

### 3. Builder Pattern

The Builder Pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. This pattern is particularly useful for creating objects with numerous optional parameters.

### 4. Adapter Pattern

The Adapter Pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, enabling them to collaborate. This pattern is often used when integrating new components into a legacy system.

### 5. Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is commonly used in event-driven systems.

### 6. Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it, promoting flexibility in choosing algorithms at runtime.

### 7. Command Pattern

The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing users to parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations. It is often used in systems that require undo/redo operations.

### 8. Decorator Pattern

The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. This pattern is useful for adding functionalities to objects without altering their structure, promoting adherence to the Open/Closed Principle.
